Many cite [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) for latest Covid19 numbers throughout the world.

By nature of being a data aggregation site, some of the numbers may not be completely up to date.
Using Taiwan as an example, I try to get the latest numbers directly from the source.
